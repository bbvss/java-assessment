Task 1
- Exec PersonWriteTest
- Exec PersonReadTest
why?
// PersonRecord[firstName=Heinz, lastName=Kabutz]
// org.records1.PersonClass@71d095c9

Task 2
However, with GDPR, we might want to ask for as little personal information as possible.
Let's change both PersonClass and PersonRecord to have an optional parameter for lastName.
- Exec PersonReadTest

Task 3
why?
PersonRecord[firstName=Kabutz, lastName=Heinz] why is working?
Exception in thread "main" java.io.InvalidClassException:
    PersonClass; local class incompatible: stream classdesc
    serialVersionUID = 3606827991270232798, local class
    serialVersionUID = 370566374786230668

    As we can see, the PersonRecord was read back without an issue, but the PersonClass failed.
    Can we make it work without re-running PersonWriteTest?

Task 4
Beautiful! However, we also received a stern letter from the USA that we are using a trademarked name.
Not allowed!
We change our constructors to explicitly disallow this.
