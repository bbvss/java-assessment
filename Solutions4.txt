// Potential SOLUTION 4 a
Change PersonClass

  public PersonClass(String firstName, String lastName) {
    // Solution 4
    if ("Heinz".equals(firstName))
      throw new IllegalArgumentException(
              "\"%s\" is trademarked".formatted(firstName));
    //
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
  }

  When we run our PersonReadTest, we see that the constructor of PersonClass is not called,
  thus we are still creating persons with names that might land us in hot water:
  Let's also change PersonRecord:

// SOLUTION 4 b
  public PersonRecord{
      if ("Heinz".equals(firstName))
          throw new IllegalArgumentException(
                  "\"%s\" is trademarked".formatted(firstName));
  }
  //

   Stunning. The canonical constructor is called when we read records from an ObjectInputStream.
   This means any checking code is also called.

  You might be wondering why we were able to read the record earlier, even after changing the structure of the class.
  The explanation is simple. Records by default always have a serialVersionUID of 0.
